    requirements:

   â€¢	Precipitation analysis:

        o	Find the most recent date in the dataset.
        o	Using that date, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
        o	Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names for date and precipitation.
        o	Sort the DataFrame values by "date".
        o	Plot the results in a line graph by using the DataFrame plot method.
        o	Use Pandas to print summary statistics for the precipitation data.
